## SPELLCAST TRAIT

Finesse

## FOUNDATION FEATURE

***Well-Connected:*** When you arrive in a prominent town or environment, you know somebody who calls this place home. Give them a name, note how you think they could be useful, and choose one fact from the following list:

- They owe me a favor, but they’ll be hard to find.
- They’re going to ask for something in exchange.
- They’re always in a great deal of trouble.
- We used to be together. It’s a long story.
- We didn’t part on great terms.

## SPECIALIZATION FEATURE

***Contacts Everywhere:*** Once per session, you can briefly call on a shady contact. Choose one of the following benefits and describe what brought them here to help you in this moment:

- They provide 1 handful of gold, a unique tool, or a mundane object that the situation requires.
- On your next action roll, their help provides a +3 bonus to the result of your Hope or Fear Die.
- The next time you deal damage, they snipe from the shadows, adding 2d8 to your damage roll.

## MASTERY FEATURE

***Reliable Backup:*** You can use your “Contacts Everywhere” feature three times per session. The following options are added to the list of benefits you can choose from when you use that feature:

- When you mark 1 or more Hit Points, they can rush out to shield you, reducing the Hit Points marked by 1.
- When you make a Presence Roll in conversation, they back you up. You can roll a d20 as your Hope Die.
