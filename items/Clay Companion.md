# CLAY COMPANION

When you sculpt this ball of clay into a clay animal companion, it behaves as that animal. For example, a clay spider can spin clay webs, while a clay bird can fly. The clay companion retains memory and identity across different shapes, but they can adopt new mannerisms with each form.
