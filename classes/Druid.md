# DRUID

Becoming a druid is more than an occupation; it’s a calling for those who wish to learn from and protect the magic of the wilderness. While one might underestimate a gentle druid who practices the often-quiet work of cultivating flora, druids who channel the untamed forces of nature are terrifying to behold. Druids cultivate their abilities in small groups, often connected by a specific ethos or locale, but some choose to work alone. Through years of study and dedication, druids can learn to transform into beasts and shape nature itself.

> **• DOMAINS:** [Sage](../domains/Sage.md) & [Arcana](../domains/Arcana.md)  
> **• STARTING EVASION:** 10  
> **• STARTING HIT POINTS:** 6  
> **• CLASS ITEMS:** A small bag of rocks and bones or a strange pendant found in the dirt

## DRUID’S HOPE FEATURE

***Evolution:*** Spend 3 Hope to transform into a Beastform without marking a Stress. When you do, choose one trait to raise by +1 until you drop out of that Beastform.

## CLASS FEATURES

***Beastform:*** Mark a Stress to magically transform into a creature of your tier or lower from the Beastform list. You can drop out of this form at any time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons or cast spells from domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you have access to. Spells you cast before you transform stay active and last for their normal duration, and you can talk and communicate as normal. Additionally, you gain the Beastform’s features, add their Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics for your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you automatically drop out of this form.

***Wildtouch:*** You can perform harmless, subtle effects that involve nature—such as causing a flower to rapidly grow, summoning a slight gust of wind, or starting a campfire—at will.

## DRUID SUBCLASSES

Choose either the **[Warden of the Elements](../subclasses/Warden%20of%20the%20Elements.md)** or **[Warden of Renewal](../subclasses/Warden%20of%20Renewal.md)** subclass.

## BACKGROUND QUESTIONS

*Answer any of the following background questions. You can also create your own questions.*

- Why was the community you grew up in so reliant on nature and its creatures?
- Who was the first wild animal you bonded with? Why did your bond end?
- Who has been trying to hunt you down? What do they want from you?

## CONNECTIONS

*Ask your fellow players one of the following questions for their character to answer, or create your own questions.*

- What did you confide in me that makes me leap into danger for you every time?
- What animal do I say you remind me of?
- What affectionate nickname have you given me?

# BEASTFORM OPTIONS

When you use your “Beastform” feature, choose a creature category of your tier or lower. At the GM’s discretion, you can describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category.

Beastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes the following details:

- **Creature Category:** Each category’s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).
- **Character Trait:** While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.
- **Attack Rolls:** When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creature’s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.
- **Evasion:** While transformed, you add the creature’s Evasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says “Evasion +2,” your Evasion becomes 10 while you’re in that form.
- **Advantage:** Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities.
- **Features:** Each form includes unique features. For example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dexterous movement—but they’re also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of Beastform.
