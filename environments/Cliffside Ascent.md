# CLIFFSIDE ASCENT

***Tier 1 Traversal***  
*A steep, rocky cliffside tall enough to make traversal dangerous.*  
**Impulses:** Cast the unwary down to a rocky doom, draw people in with promise of what lies at the top

> **Difficulty:** 12  
> **Potential Adversaries:** Construct, Deeproot Defender, Giant Scorpion, Glass Snake

## FEATURES

***The Climb - Passive:*** Climbing up the cliffside uses a Progress Countdown (12). It ticks down according to the following criteria when the PCs make an action roll to climb:

  - Critical Success: Tick down 3
  - Success with Hope: Tick down 2
  - Success with Fear: Tick down 1
  - Failure with Hope: No advancement
  - Failure with Fear: Tick up 1

  When the countdown triggers, the party has made it to the top of the cliff.

  *What strange formations are the stones arranged in? What ominous warnings did previous adventurers leave?*

***Pitons Left Behind - Passive:*** Previous climbers left behind large metal rods that climbers can use to aid their ascent. If a PC using the pitons fails an action roll to climb, they can mark a Stress instead of ticking the countdown up.

  *What do the shape and material of these pitons tell you about the previous climbers? How far apart are they from one another?*

***Fall - Action:*** Spend a Fear to have a PC’s handhold fail, plummeting them toward the ground. If they aren’t saved on the next action, they must make a roll; tick up the countdown by 1, and they take 1d12 physical damage if the countdown is between 8 and 12, 2d12 between 4 and 7, and 3d12 at 3 or lower.

  *How can you tell how many others have fallen here before? What lives in these walls that might try to scare adventurers into falling for an easy meal?*
