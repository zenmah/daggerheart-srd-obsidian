## FEATURES

***Engraved Sigils - Passive:*** Large markings and engravings have been made in the mountainside. A PC with a relevant background or Experience identifies them as weather magic increasing the power of the icy winds. A PC who succeeds on a Knowledge Roll can recall information about the sigils, potential information about their creators, and the knowledge of how to dispel them. If a PC critically succeeds, they recognize that the sigils are of a style created by highborne enchanters and they gain advantage on a roll to dispel the sigils.

  *Who laid this enchantment? Are they nearby? Why did they want the weather to be more daunting?*

***Avalanche - Action:*** Spend a Fear to carve the mountain with an icy torrent, causing an avalanche. All PCs in its path must succeed on an Agility or Strength Reaction Roll or be bowled over and carried down the mountain. A PC using rope, pitons, or other climbing gear gains advantage on this roll. Targets who fail are knocked down the mountain to Far range, take 2d20 physical damage, and must mark a Stress. Targets who succeed must mark a Stress.

  *How do the PCs try to weather the avalanche? What approach do they take to avoid being buried or hurtling down the mountainside?*

***Raptor Nest - Reaction:*** When the PCs enter the raptors’ hunting grounds, two Giant Eagles appear at Very Far range of a chosen PC, identifying the PCs as likely prey.

  *How long has it been since the eagles last found prey? Do they have eggs in their nest, or unfledged young?*

***Icy Winds - Reaction:*** Countdown (Loop 4). When the PCs enter the mountain pass, activate the countdown. When it triggers, all characters traveling through the pass must succeed on a Strength Reaction Roll or mark a Stress. A PC wearing clothes appropriate for extreme cold gains advantage on these rolls.

  *What parts of the PCs’ bodies go numb first? How do they try to keep warm as they press forward?*
