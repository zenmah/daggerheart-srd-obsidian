# RAGING RIVER

***Tier 1 Traversal***  
*A swift-moving river without a bridge crossing, deep enough to sweep away most people.*  
**Impulses:** Bar crossing, carry away the unready, divide the land

> **Difficulty:** 10  
> **Potential Adversaries:** Beasts (Bear, Glass Snake), Jagged Knife Bandits (Hexer, Kneebreaker, Lackey, Lieutenant, Shadow, Sniper)

## FEATURES

***Dangerous Crossing - Passive:*** Crossing the river requires the party to complete a Progress Countdown (4). A PC who rolls a failure with Fear is immediately targeted by the “Undertow” action without requiring a Fear to be spent on the feature.

  *Have any of the PCs forded rivers like this before? Are any of them afraid of drowning?*

***Undertow - Action:*** Spend a Fear to catch a PC in the undertow. They must make an Agility Reaction Roll. On a failure, they take 1d6+1 physical damage and are moved a Close distance down the river, becoming Vulnerable until they get out of the river. On a success, they must mark a Stress.

  *What trinkets and baubles lie along the bottom of the riverbed? Do predators swim these rivers?*

***Patient Hunter - Action:*** Spend a Fear to summon a Glass Snake within Close range of a chosen PC. The Snake appears in or near the river and immediately takes the spotlight to use their “Spinning Serpent” action.

  *What treasures does the beast have in their burrow? What travelers have already fallen victim to this predator?*
