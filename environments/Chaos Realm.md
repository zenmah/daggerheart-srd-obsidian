## FEATURES

***Impossible Architecture - Passive:*** Up is down, down is right, right is a stairway. Gravity and directionality themselves are in flux, and any attempt to move through this realm is an odyssey unto itself, requiring a Progress Countdown (8). On a failure, a PC must mark a Stress in addition to the roll’s other consequences.

  *What does it feel like to move in a space so alien to the Mortal Realm? What landmark or point do you fixate on to maintain your balance? What bizarre landmarks do you traverse on your journey?*

***Everything You Are This Place Will Take from You - Action:*** Countdown (Loop 14). Activate the countdown. When it triggers, all PCs must succeed on a Presence Reaction Roll or their highest trait is temporarily reduced by 1d4 unless they mark a number of Stress equal to its value. Any lost trait points are regained if the PC critically succeeds or escapes the Chaos Realm.

  *How does this place try to steal from you that which makes you legendary? What does it feel like to have this power taken from you?*

***Unmake - Action:*** On a failure, they take 4d10 direct magic damage. On a success, they must mark a Stress.

  *What glimpse of other worlds do you catch while this place tries to unmake you? What core facet of your personality does the unmaking try to erase?*

***Outer Realms Predators - Action:*** Spend a Fear to summon an Outer Realms Abomination, an Outer Realms Corruptor, and 2d6 Outer Realms Thralls, who appear at Close range of a chosen PC in defiance of logic and causality. Immediately spotlight one of these adversaries, and you can spend an additional Fear to automatically succeed on that adversary’s standard attack.

  *What half-consumed remnants of the shattered soul do these monstrosities cast aside in pursuit of living flesh? What jagged reflections of former personhood do you catch between moments of unquenching malice?*

***Disorienting Reality - Reaction:*** On a result with Fear, you can ask the PC to describe which of their fears the Chaos Realm evokes as a vision of reality unmakes and reconstitutes itself to the PC. The PC loses a Hope. If it is their last Hope, you gain a Fear.

  *What moment do they see? If it’s a memory, how is it usurped by this place? How hard will it be to hold on to the real memory?*
