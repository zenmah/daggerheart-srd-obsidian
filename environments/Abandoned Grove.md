## FEATURES

***Overgrown Battlefield - Passive:*** There has been a battle here. A PC can make an Instinct Roll to identify evidence of that fight. On a success with Hope, learn all three pieces of information below. On a success with Fear, learn two. On a failure, a PC can mark 3 Stress to learn one and gain advantage on the next action roll to investigate this environment. A PC with an appropriate background or Experience can learn an additional detail and ask a follow-up question about the scene and get a truthful (if not always complete) answer.

  - Traces of a battle (broken weapons and branches, gouges in the ground) litter the ground.
  - A moss-covered tree trunk is actually the corpse of a treant.
  - Still-standing trees are twisted in strange ways, as if by powerful magic.

***Barbed Vines - Action:*** Pick a point within the grove. All targets within Very Close range of that point must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or take 1d8+3 physical damage and become Restrained by barbed vines. Restrained lasts until they’re freed with a successful Finesse or Strength roll or by dealing at least 6 damage to the vines.

***You Are Not Welcome Here - Action:*** A Young Dryad, two Sylvan Soldiers, and a number of Minor Treants equal to the number of PCs appear to confront the party for their intrusion.

***Defiler - Action:*** Spend a Fear to summon a Minor Chaos Adversary drawn to the echoes of violence and discord. They appear within Far range of a chosen PC and immediately take the spotlight.
