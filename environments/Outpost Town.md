## FEATURES

***Rumors Abound - Passive:*** Gossip is the fastest-traveling currency in the realm. A PC can inquire about major events by making a Presence Roll. What they learn depends on the outcome of their roll, based on the following criteria:

  - Critical Success: Learn about two major events. The PC can ask one follow-up question about one of the rumors and get a truthful (if not always complete) answer.
  - Success with Hope: Learn about two events, at least one of which is relevant to the character’s background.
  - Success with Fear: Learn an alarming rumor related to the character’s background.
  - Any Failure: The locals respond poorly to their inquiries. The PC must mark a Stress to learn one relevant rumor.

  *What news do the PCs hear that they could pass along to curious travelers? What do the locals think about these events?*

***Society of the Broken Compass - Passive:*** An adventuring society maintains a chapterhouse here, where heroes meet to exchange news and rumors, drink to their imagined successes, and scheme to undermine their rivals.

  *What boasts do the adventurers here make, and which do you think are true?*

***Rival Party - Passive:*** Another adventuring party is here, seeking the same treasure or leads as the PCs.

  *Which PC has a connection to one of the rival party members? Do they approach the PC first or do they wait for the PC to move?*

***It’d Be a Shame If Something Happened to Your Store - Action:*** The PCs witness as agents of a local crime boss shake down a general goods store.

  *What trouble does it cause if the PCs intervene?*

***Wrong Place, Wrong Time - Reaction:*** At night, or when the party is alone in a back alley, you can spend a Fear to introduce a group of thieves who try to rob them. The thieves appear at Close range of a chosen PC and include a Jagged Knife Kneebreaker, as many Lackeys as there are PCs, and a Lieutenant. For a larger party, add 2 Hexer or Sniper.

  *What details show the party that these people are desperate former adventurers?*
