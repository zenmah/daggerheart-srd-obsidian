## FEATURES

***What’s the Talk of the Town? - Passive:*** A PC can ask the bartender, staff, or patrons about local events, rumors, and potential work with a Presence Roll. On a success, they can pick two of the below details to learn—or three if they critically succeed. On a failure, they can pick one and mark a Stress as the local carries on about something irrelevant.

  - A fascinating rumor with a connection to a PC’s background
  - A promising job for the party involving a nearby threat or situation
  - Local folklore that relates to something they’ve seen
  - Town gossip that hints at a community problem

  *Who has what kind of information? What gossip do the locals start spreading about the PCs?*

***Sing for Your Supper - Passive:*** A PC can perform one time for the guests by making a Presence Roll. On a success, they earn 1d4 handfuls of gold (2d4 if they critically succeed). On a failure, they mark a Stress.

  *What piece do you perform? What does that piece mean to you? When’s the last time you performed it for a crowd?*

***Mysterious Stranger - Action:*** Reveal a stranger concealing their identity, lurking in a shaded booth.

  *What do they want? What’s their impression of the PCs? What mannerisms or accessories do they have?*

***Someone Comes to Town - Action:*** Introduce a significant NPC who wants to hire the party for something or who relates to a PC’s background.

  *Did they know the PCs were here? What do they want in this town?*

***Bar Fight - Action:*** Spend a Fear to have a bar fight erupt in the tavern. When a PC tries to move through the tavern while the fight persists, they must succeed on an Agility or Presence Roll or take 1d6+2 physical damage from a wild swing or thrown object. A PC can try to activate this feature by succeeding on an action roll that would provoke tavern patrons.

  *Who started the fight? What will it take to stop it?*
