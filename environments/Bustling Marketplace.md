## FEATURES

***Tip the Scales - Passive:*** PCs can gain advantage on a Presence Roll by offering a handful of gold as part of the interaction.

  *Will any coin be accepted, or only local currency? How overt are the PCs in offering this bribe?*

***Unexpected Find - Action:*** Reveal to the PCs that one of the merchants has something they want or need, such as food from their home, a rare book, magical components, a dubious treasure map, or a magical key.

  *What cost beyond gold will the merchant ask for in exchange for this rarity?*

***Sticky Fingers - Action:*** A thief tries to steal something from a PC. The PC must succeed on an Instinct Roll to notice the thief or lose an item of the GM’s choice as the thief escapes to a Close distance. To retrieve the stolen item, the PCs must complete a Progress Countdown (6) to chase down the thief before the thief completes a Consequence Countdown (4) and escapes to their hideout.

  *What drove this person to pickpocketing? Where is the thief’s hideout and how has it avoided notice?*

***Crowd Control - Reaction:*** When one of the PCs splits from the group, the crowds shift and cut them off from the party.

  *Where does the crowd’s movement carry them? How do they feel about being alone but surrounded?*
