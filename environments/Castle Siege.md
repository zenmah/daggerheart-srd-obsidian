# CASTLE SIEGE

***Tier 3 Event***  
*An active siege with an attacking force fighting to gain entry to a fortified castle.*  
**Impulses:** Bleed out the will to fight, breach the walls, build tension

> **Difficulty:** 17  
> **Potential Adversaries:** Mercenaries (Harrier, Sellsword, Spellblade, Weaponmaster), Noble Forces (Archer Squadron, Conscript, Elite Soldier, Knight of the Realm)

## FEATURES

***Secret Entrance - Passive:*** A PC can find or recall a secret way into the castle with a successful Instinct or Knowledge Roll.

  *How do they get in without revealing the pathway to the attackers? Are any of the defenders monitoring this path?*

***Siege Weapons (Environment Change) - Action:*** Consequence Countdown (5). The attacking force deploys siege weapons to try to raze the defenders’ fortifications. Activate the countdown when the siege begins (for a protracted siege, make this a long-term countdown instead). When it triggers, the defenders’ fortifications have been breached and the attackers flood in. You gain 2 Fear, then shift to the Pitched Battle environment and spotlight it.

  *What siege weapons are being deployed? Are they magical, mundane, or a mixture of both? What defenses must the characters overcome to storm the castle?*

***Reinforcements - Action:*** Summon a Knight of the Realm, a number of Tier 3 Minions equal to the number of PCs, and two adversaries of your choice within Far range of a chosen PC as reinforcements. The Knight of the Realm immediately takes the spotlight.

  *Who are they targeting first? What formation do they take?*

***Collateral Damage - Reaction:*** When an adversary is defeated, you can spend a Fear to have a stray attack from a siege weapon hit a point on the battlefield. All targets within Very Close range of that point must make an Agility Reaction Roll.

  - Targets who fail take 3d8+3 physical or magic damage and must mark a Stress.
  - Targets who succeed must mark a Stress.

  *What debris is scattered by the attack? What is broken by the strike that can’t be easily mended?*
