## FEATURES

***Chaos Magic Locus - Passive:*** When a PC makes a Spellcast Roll, they must roll two Fear Dice and take the higher result.

  *What does it feel like to work magic in this chaos-touched place? What do you fear will happen if you lose control of the spell?*

***The Indigo Flame - Passive:*** PCs who approach the central tree can make a Knowledge Roll to try to identify the magic that consumed this environment.

  - On a success: They learn three of the below details. On a success with Fear, they learn two.
  - On a failure: They can mark a Stress to learn one and gain advantage on the next action roll to investigate this environment.
  - Details: This is a result of Fallen magic. The corruption is spread through the ashen moss. It can be cleansed only by a ritual of nature magic with a Progress Countdown (8).

  *What fell cult corrupted these woods? What have they already done with the cursed wood and sap from this tree?*

***Grasping Vines - Action:*** Animate vines bristling with thorns whip out from the underbrush to ensnare the PCs. A target must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or become Restrained and Vulnerable until they break free, clearing both conditions, with a successful Finesse or Strength Roll or by dealing 10 damage to the vines. When the target makes a roll to escape, they take 1d8+4 physical damage and lose a Hope.

  *What painful memories do the vines bring to the surface as they pierce flesh?*

***Charcoal Constructs - Action:*** Warped animals wreathed in indigo flame trample through a point of your choice. All targets within Close range of that point must make an Agility Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 3d12+3 physical damage. Targets who succeed take half damage instead.

  *Are these real animals consumed by the flame or merely constructs of the corrupting magic?*

***Choking Ash - Reaction:*** Countdown (Loop 6). When the PCs enter the Burning Heart of the Woods, activate the countdown. When it triggers, all characters must make a Strength or Instinct Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 4d6+5 direct physical damage. Targets who succeed take half damage. Protective masks or clothes give advantage on the reaction roll.

  *What hallucinations does the ash induce? What incongruous taste does it possess?*
