# STRESS

**Stress** represents how much mental, physical, and emotional strain a character can endure. Some special abilities or effects require the character activating them to mark Stress, and the GM can require a PC to mark Stress as a GM move or to represent the cost, complication, or consequence of an action roll.

When a character marks their last Stress, they become **Vulnerable** (see: Conditions) until they clear at least 1 Stress.

When a character must mark 1 or more Stress but can’t, they mark 1 HP instead. A character can’t use a move that requires them to mark Stress if all of their Stress is marked.

PCs can clear Stress by making downtime moves (see: Downtime). A PC’s maximum Stress is determined by their class, but they can increase it through advancements, abilities, and other effects.
