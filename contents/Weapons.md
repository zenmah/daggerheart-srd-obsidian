# WEAPONS

All weapons have a tier, trait, range, damage die, damage type, and burden. Some weapons also have a feature.

## CATEGORY

A weapon’s **category** specifies whether it is a Primary or Secondary weapon. Your character can only equip up to one weapon of each category at a time.

## TRAIT

A weapon’s **trait** specifies which trait to use when making an attack roll with it.

## RANGE

A weapon’s range specifies the maximum distance between the attacker and their target when attacking with it.

## DAMAGE

A weapon’s **damage** indicates the size of the damage dice you roll on a successful attack with it; you roll a number of dice equal to your Proficiency. If the damage includes a flat modifier, this number is added to the total damage rolled, but is not altered or affected by Proficiency.

## DAMAGE TYPE

A weapon’s **damage type** indicates whether it deals physical or magic damage. Weapons that deal magic damage can only be wielded by characters with a Spellcast trait.

## BURDEN

A weapon’s **burden** indicates how many **hands** it occupies when equipped. Your character’s maximum burden is 2 hands.

## FEATURE

A weapon’s **feature** is a special rule that stays in effect while the weapon is equipped.

You can throw an equipped weapon at a target within Very Close range, making the attack roll with Finesse. On a success, deal damage as usual for that weapon. Once thrown, the weapon is no longer considered equipped. Until you retrieve and re-equip it, you can’t attack with it or benefit from its features.
