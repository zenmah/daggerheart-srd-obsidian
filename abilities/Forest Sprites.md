# FOREST SPRITES

> **Level 8 Sage Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

Make a Spellcast Roll (13). On a success, spend any number of Hope to create an equal number of small forest sprites who appear at points you choose within Far range, providing the following benefits:

- Your allies gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls against adversaries within Melee range of a sprite.
- An ally who marks an Armor Slot while within Melee range of a sprite can mark an additional Armor Slot.

A sprite vanishes after granting a benefit or taking any damage.
