> **Level 7 Splendor Ability**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

When 4 or more of the domain cards in your loadout are from the Splendor domain, gain the following benefits:

- +3 bonus to your Severe damage threshold
- Once per long rest, when incoming damage would require you to mark a number of Hit Points, you can choose to mark that much Stress or spend that much Hope instead.
