Make a Spellcast Roll (13). On a success, spend 2 Hope to grow a natural barricade in the shape of a dome that you and one ally can take cover within. While inside the dome, a creature can’t be targeted by attacks and can’t make attacks. Attacks made against the dome automatically succeed. The dome has the following damage thresholds and lasts until it marks 3 Hit Points. Place tokens on this card to represent marking Hit Points.

**Thresholds: 15/30**
