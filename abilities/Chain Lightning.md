Mark 2 Stress to make a Spellcast Roll, unleashing lightning on all targets within Close range. Targets you succeed against must make a reaction roll with a Difficulty equal to the result of your Spellcast Roll. Targets who fail take 2d8+4 magic damage.

This chain continues until there are no more adversaries within range.
