# PREMONITION

> **Level 5 Arcana Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

You can channel arcane energy to have visions of the future. Once per long rest, immediately after the GM conveys the consequences of a roll you made, you can rescind the move and consequences like they never happened and make another move instead.
