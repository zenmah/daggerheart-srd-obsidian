# RESTORATION

> **Level 6 Splendor Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

After a long rest, place a number of tokens equal to your Spellcast trait on this card. Touch a creature and spend any number of tokens to clear 2 Hit Points or 2 Stress for each token spent.

You can also spend a token from this card when touching a creature to clear the Vulnerable condition or heal a physical or magical ailment (the GM might require additional tokens depending on the strength of the ailment).

When you take a long rest, clear all unspent tokens.
