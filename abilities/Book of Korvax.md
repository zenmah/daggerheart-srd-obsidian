**Levitation:** Make a Spellcast Roll to temporarily lift a target you can see up into the air and move them within Close range of their original position.

**Recant:** Spend a Hope to force a target within Melee range to make a Reaction Roll (15). On a failure, they forget the last minute of your conversation.

**Rune Circle:** Mark a Stress to create a temporary magical circle on the ground where you stand. All adversaries within Melee range, who enter Melee range, take 2d12+4 magic damage and are knocked back to Very Close range.
