**Wild Flame:** Make a Spellcast Roll against up to three adversaries within Melee range. Targets you succeed against take 2d6 magic damage and must mark a Stress as flames erupt from your hand.

**Magic Hand:** You conjure a magical hand with the same size and strength as your own within Far range.

**Mysterious Mist:** Make a Spellcast Roll (13) to cast a temporary thick fog that gathers in a stationary area within Very Close range. The fog heavily obscures this area and everything in it.
