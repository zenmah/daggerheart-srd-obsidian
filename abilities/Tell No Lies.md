# TELL NO LIES

Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Very Close range. On a success, they can’t lie to you while they remain within Close range, but they are not compelled to speak. If you ask them a question and they refuse to answer, they must mark a Stress and the effect ends. The target is typically unaware this spell has been cast on them until it causes them to utter the truth.
