# FLIGHT

> **Level 3 Arcana Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

Make a Spellcast Roll (15). On a success, place a number of tokens equal to your Agility on this card (minimum 1). When you make an action roll while flying, spend a token from this card. After the action that spends the last token is resolved, you descend to the ground directly below you.
