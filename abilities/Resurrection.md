# RESURRECTION

> **Level 10 Splendor Spell**  
> **Recall Cost:** 2

Make a Spellcast Roll (20). On a success, restore one creature who has been dead no longer than 100 years to full strength. Then roll a d6. On a result of 5 or lower, place this card in your vault permanently.

On a failure, you can’t cast Resurrection again for a week.
