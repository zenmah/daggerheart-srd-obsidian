# CHOKEHOLD

> **Level 3 Midnight Ability**  
> **Recall Cost:** 1

When you position yourself behind a creature who’s about your size, you can mark a Stress to pull them into a chokehold, making them temporarily Vulnerable.

When a creature attacks a target who is Vulnerable in this way, they deal an extra 2d6 damage.
