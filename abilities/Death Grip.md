Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Close range and choose one of the following options:

- You pull the target into Melee range or pull yourself into Melee range of them.
- You constrict the target and force them to mark 2 Stress.

On a success, vines reach out from your hands, causing the chosen effect and temporarily Restraining the target.
