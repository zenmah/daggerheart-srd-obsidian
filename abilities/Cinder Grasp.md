Make a Spellcast Roll against a target within Melee range. On a success, the target instantly bursts into flames, takes 12d20+3 magic damage, and is temporarily lit On Fire.

When a creature acts while On Fire, they must take an extra 2d6 magic damage if they are still On Fire at the end of their action.
