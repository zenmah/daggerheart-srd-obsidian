**Pass Through:** Make a Spellcast Roll (13). Once per rest on a success, you and all creatures touching you can pass through a wall or door within Close range. The effect ends once everyone is on the other side.

**Plane Gate:** Make a Spellcast Roll (14). Once per long rest on a success, open a gateway to a location in another dimension or plane of existence you’ve been to before. This gateway lasts until your next rest.
