Make a Spellcast Roll against all adversaries in front of you within Close range. Once per rest on a success, create an illusion of flashing colors and lights that temporarily Stuns targets you succeed against and forces them to mark a Stress. While Stunned, they can’t use reactions and can’t take any other actions until they clear this condition.
