Members of this class are masters of captivation and specialize in a variety of performance types, including singing, playing musical instruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes. Whether performing for an audience or speaking to an individual, bards thrive in social situations. Members of this profession bond and train at schools or guilds, but a current of egotism runs through those of the bardic persuasion. While they may be the most likely class to bring people together, a bard of ill temper can just as easily tear a party apart.",

    "extras": "# BEASTFORM OPTIONS\n\nWhen you use your “Beastform” feature, choose a creature category of your tier or lower. At the GM’s discretion, you can describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably fits into that category.\n\nBeastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes the following details:\n\n- **Creature Category:** Each category’s name describes the common role or behavior of creatures in that category (such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few examples of animals that fit in that category (in this example, fox, mouse, and weasel).\n- **Character Trait:** While transformed, you gain a bonus to the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this form drops, you lose this bonus.\n- **Attack Rolls:** When you make an attack while transformed, you use the creature’s listed range, trait, and damage dice, but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.\n- **Evasion:** While transformed, you add the creature’s Evasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says “Evasion +2,” your Evasion becomes 10 while you’re in that form.\n- **Advantage:** Your form makes you especially suited to certain actions. When you make an action or reaction roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak around, search for objects or creatures, and related activities.\n- **Features:** Each form includes unique features. For example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dexterous movement—but they’re also fragile, making you more likely to drop out of Beastform.\n\n## TIER 1\n\n### AGILE SCOUT\n\n(Fox, Mouse, Weasel, etc.)\n\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d4 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** deceive, locate, sneak\n\n***Agile:*** Your movement is silent, and you can spend a Hope to move up to Far range without rolling.\n\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\n\n### HOUSEHOLD FRIEND\n\n(Cat, Dog, Rabbit, etc.)\n\n> Instinct +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Instinct d6 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** climb, locate, protect\n\n***Companion:*** When you Help an Ally, you can roll a d8 as your advantage die.\n\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\n\n### NIMBLE GRAZER\n\n(Deer, Gazelle, Goat, etc.)\n\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +3 | Melee Agility d6 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** leap, sneak, sprint\n\n***Elusive Prey:*** When an attack roll against you would succeed, you can mark a Stress and roll a d4. Add the result to your Evasion against this attack.\n\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\n\n### PACK PREDATOR\n\n(Coyote, Hyena, Wolf, etc.)\n\n> Strength +2 | Evasion +1 | Melee Strength d8+2 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** attack, sprint, track\n\n***Hobbling Strike:*** When you succeed on an attack against a target within Melee range, you can mark a Stress to make the target temporarily Vulnerable.\n\n***Pack Hunting:*** When you succeed on an attack against the same target as an ally who acts immediately before you, add a d8 to your damage roll.\n\n### AQUATIC SCOUT\n\n(Eel, Fish, Octopus, etc.)\n\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d4 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** navigate, sneak, swim\n\n***Aquatic:*** You can breathe and move naturally underwater.\n\n***Fragile:*** When you take Major or greater damage, you drop out of Beastform.\n\n### STALKING ARACHNID\n\n(Tarantula, Wolf Spider, etc.)\n\n> Finesse +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Finesse d6+1 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** attack, climb, sneak\n\n***Venomous Bite:*** When you succeed on an attack against a target within Melee range, the target becomes temporarily Poisoned. A Poisoned creature takes 1d10 direct physical damage each time they act.\n\n***Webslinger:*** You can create a strong web material useful for both adventuring and battle. The web is resilient enough to support one creature. You can temporarily Restrain a target within Close range by succeeding on a Finesse Roll against them.\n\n### MIGHTY STRIDER\n\n(Camel, Horse, Zebra, etc.)\n\n> Agility +1 | Evasion +2 | Melee Agility d8+1 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** leap, navigate, sprint\n\n***Carrier:*** You can carry up to two willing allies with you when you move.\n\n***Trample:*** Mark a Stress to move up to Close range in a straight line and make an attack against all targets within Melee range of the line.

The second target takes half the damage dealt to the first target.\n\n### POWERFUL BEAST\n\n(Bear, Bull, Moose, etc.)\n\n> Strength +3 | Evasion +1 | Melee Strength d10+4 phy  \n> **Gain advantage on:** navigate, protect, scare\n\n***Rampage:*** When you roll a 1 on a damage die, you can roll a d10 and add the result to the damage roll.

A wide array of deities exist within the realms, and thus numerous kinds of seraphs are appointed by these gods. Their ethos traditionally aligns with the domain or goals of their god, such as defending the weak, exacting vengeance, protecting a land or artifact, or upholding a particular faith. Some seraphs ally themselves with an army or locale, much to the satisfaction of their rulers, but other crusaders fight in opposition to the follies of the Mortal Realm. It is better to be a seraph’s ally than their enemy, as they are terrifying foes to those who defy their purpose.",
