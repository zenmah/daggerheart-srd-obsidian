***Battering Ram - Action:*** Mark a Stress to have the Brawler charge at an inanimate object within Close range they could feasibly smash (such as a wall, cart, or market stand) and destroy it. All targets within Very Close range of the object must succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or take 2d4+3 physical damage from the shrapnel.

***Bloody Reprisal - Reaction:*** When the Brawler marks 2 or more HP from an attack within Very Close range, you can make a standard attack against the attacker. On a success, the Brawler deals 2d6+15 physical damage instead of their standard damage.

***Momentum - Reaction:*** When the Brawler makes a successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.
