## FEATURES

***Relentless (2) - Passive:*** The Realm-Breaker can be spotlighted up to two times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight them.

***Firespite Plate Armor - Passive:*** When the Realm-Breaker takes damage, reduce it by 2d10.

***Tormenting Lash - Action:*** Mark a Stress to make a standard attack against all targets within Very Close range. When a target uses armor to reduce damage from this attack, they must mark 2 Armor Slots.

***All-Consuming Rage - Reaction:*** Countdown (Decreasing 8). When the Realm-Breaker is in the spotlight for the first time, activate the countdown. When it triggers, create a torrent of incarnate rage that rends flesh from bone. All targets within Far range must make a Presence Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 2d6+10 direct magic damage. Targets who succeed take half damage. For each HP marked from this damage, summon a Fallen Shock Troop within Very Close range of the target who marked that HP. If the countdown ever decreases its maximum value to 0, the Realm-Breaker marks their remaining HP and all targets within Far range must mark all remaining HP and make a death move.

***Doombringer - Reaction:*** When a target marks HP from an attack by the Realm-Breaker, all PCs within Far range of the target must lose a Hope.

***I Have Never Known Defeat (Phase Change) - Reaction:*** When the Realm-Breaker marks their last HP, replace them with the Undefeated Champion and immediately spotlight them.
