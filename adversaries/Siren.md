## FEATURES

***Captive Audience - Passive:*** If the Siren makes a standard attack against a target Entranced by their song, the attack deals 2d10+1 damage instead of their standard damage.

***Enchanting Song - Action:*** Spend a Fear to sing a song that affects all targets within Close range. Targets must succeed on an Instinct Reaction Roll or become Entranced until they mark 2 Stress. Other Sirens within Close range of the target can mark a Stress to each add a +1 bonus to the Difficulty of the reaction roll. While Entranced, a target can’t act and is Vulnerable.
