## FEATURES

***Minion (4) - Passive:*** The Bramble is defeated when they take any damage. For every 4 damage a PC deals to the Tangle Bramble, defeat an additional Minion within range the attack would succeed against.

***Group Attack - Action:*** Spend a Fear to choose a target and spotlight all Tangle Brambles within Close range of them. Those Minions move into Melee range of the target and make one shared attack roll. On a success, they deal 2 physical damage each. Combine this damage.

***Drain and Multiply - Reaction:*** When an attack from the Bramble causes a target to mark HP and there are three or more Tangle Bramble Minions within Close range, you can combine the Minions into a Tangle Bramble Swarm Horde. The Horde’s HP is equal to the number of Minions combined.
