## FEATURES

***Money Talks - Passive:*** Attacks against the Demon are made with disadvantage unless the attacker spends a handful of gold. This Demon starts with a number of handfuls equal to the number of PCs. When a target marks HP from the Demon’s standard attack, they can spend a handful of gold instead of marking HP (1 handful per HP). Add a handful of gold to the Demon for each handful of gold spent by PCs on this feature.

***Numbers Must Go Up - Passive:*** Add a bonus to the Demon’s attack rolls equal to the number of handfuls of gold they have.

***Money is Time - Action:*** Spend 3 handfuls of gold (or a Fear) to spotlight 1d4+1 allies.
