## FEATURES

***Terrifying - Passive:*** When the Hunter makes a successful attack, all PCs within Far range lose a Hope and you gain a Fear.

***Deathlock - Action:*** Spend a Fear to curse a target within Very Close range with a necrotic Deathlock until the end of the scene. Attacks made by the Hunter against a Deathlocked target deal direct damage. The Hunter can only maintain one Deathlock at a time.

***Inevitable Death - Action:*** Mark a Stress to spotlight 1d4 allies. Attacks they make while spotlighted in this way deal half damage.

***Rampage - Reaction:*** Countdown (Loop 1d6). When the Hunter is in the spotlight for the first time, activate the countdown. When it triggers, move the Hunter in a straight line to a point within Far range and make an attack against all targets in their path. Targets the Hunter succeeds against take 2d8+2 physical damage.
