## FEATURES

***Creeping Fire - Passive:*** The Ooze can only move within Very Close range as their normal movement. They light any flammable object they touch on fire.

***Ignite - Action:*** Make an attack against a target within Very Close range. On a success, the target takes 1d8 magic damage and is ignited until they’re extinguished with a successful Finesse Roll (14). While ignited, the target takes 1d4 magic damage when they make an action roll.

***Split - Reaction:*** When the Ooze has 3 or more HP marked, you can spend a Fear to split them into two Tiny Red Oozes (with no marked HP or Stress). Immediately spotlight both of them.
