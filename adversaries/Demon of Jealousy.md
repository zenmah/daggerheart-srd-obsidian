## FEATURES

***Unprotected Mind - Passive:*** The Demon’s standard attack deals direct damage.

***My Turn - Reaction:*** When the Demon marks HP from an attack, spend a number of Fear equal to the HP marked by the Demon to cause the attacker to mark the same number of HP.

***Rivalry - Reaction:*** When a creature within Close range takes damage from a different adversary, you can mark a Stress to add a d4 to the damage roll.

***What’s Yours Is Mine - Reaction:*** When a PC takes severe damage within Very Close range of the Demon, you can spend a Fear to cause the target to make a Finesse Reaction Roll. On a failure, the Demon seizes one item or consumable of their choice from the target’s inventory.
